# Holy Cross College Board of Trustees | Academic Affairs Committee  
April 8, 2021

## Time: 
The meeting began at 12:00 pm EDT and ended at 1:00 pm EDT.

## Present:
Barbara O’Connor; Amy Cavender; Br. William Dygert, CSC;  Pia de Solenni; Justin Watson; Anthony Monta; David Lutz

## Absent:
Br. Donald Stabrowski, CSC

## Opening prayer and introductions
Brother William Dygert opened the meeting with a prayer.

Since some of the attendees were new to the committee, committee members took some time to introduce themselves to each other.

## Discussion of draft charter
Following introductions, the committee turned to a discussion of the draft of the committee charter.

The committee’s job can be summarized as accountability and oversight of the College’s academic functions.

A question was raised about whether we should have a student on the committee. The general consensus was yes, we should, once we’re better organized as a committee; we need a student perspective.

Committee members will have a few days to make any additional comments and/or suggestions about the draft charter to Barb, who’ll incorporate them into a finalized version that she’ll send around for approval early next week.

## Updates and areas of concern

Justin Watson shared some updates and areas of concern with the committee:

### Faculty resources
Currently there are only twenty-three full-time faculty. The College needs more people, with appropriate academic backgrounds.

The College is trying to hire outstanding people at fair market value (and in some fields — science and business in particular — that’s costly).

Though the College’s Development Office is under-resourced, the endowment is now providing a little money that is being put toward academic hires.

### Accreditation
  
The College has a clean bill of health from the Higher Learning Commission, but the HLC issued two directives:
1. Update/upgrade the way the College presents its retention data (by June).  
	  
	This has already been done; updated information was posted to the website on Holy Thursday.  
	  
	*Context*:  
	HCC’s published retention rate last year was 34%. However, that number doesn’t give an accurate picture of the College’s seriousness and rigor, since the biggest reason for that low rate is the Gateway program. Unfortunately, the low retention rate also counts against us in *U.S. News & World Report* rankings.  
	  
	Going forward, Gateway students will no longer count against us in our retention reporting to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). *U.S. News & World Report* will also no longer count Gateway students against us. With this change, our freshman to sophomore retention rate doubles to 68%. It will take longer for accurate information for retention to graduation to show up in the data, but we’ll see that, too, in a few years.  

2. Program review of academics (progress report due by June 21, 2023).  
	  
	The College needs to conduct regular program reviews.  
	  
	There’s now a plan for program review that will be led by the Dean of Faculty. Starting with AY 2021-2022, the College will conduct a program review of three academic programs per year.

### Audit of policies and procedures, including the academic handbook  

It’s important for the College to conduct an audit of policies and procedures, including the academic handbook (which is in need of re-writing). The plan is to find an outsider who can come in and lead a review to ensure that our practices and handbook reflect *best* practice and are updated appropriately. Justin is looking for someone to lead this who is from a college similar to HCC, and, if retired, hasn’t been away from academia for very long.

## Conclusion and next steps

The above are the most immediately important matters for the committee, in Justin’s view. He also noted that internships are very important for our students, and any way that the Board — and this committee in particular — can assist with that area of need is appreciated.

The next steps from academic administration should be prioritizing the above concerns and planning for how to address them, and bringing the fruits of that prioritization/planning process back to the committee.
