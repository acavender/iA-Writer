# Potok and argument

It bothered me to see the teacher so brazenly offended and I lost patience one Thursday afternoon when a student sitting some rows behind me loudly riffled his newspaper while turning a page. In the corridor after the class I told him I didn’t care if he wanted to remain an ignoramus in Bible, but he was going to have to stop disturbing those who were serious about the class. 

He was a tall, stoop-shouldered boy from Brooklyn with a heavy face and dull gray eyes. His name was Irving Besser. I came up to his chest in height.

“Who are you calling an ignoramus?” he said, folding his newspaper and putting it under his arm. 

The class had gathered around us, blocking the corridor.

“You are an ignoramus in Bible,” I said, using the Hebrew term *am ha’aretz*. “That’s your privilege. I’m not asking you to study Bible. I’m asking you to be quiet so I can study Bible.” 

He put a thick strong finger on my chest and pushed ominously. “I don’t like to be called an ignoramus.” 

“Then don’t behave like one.”

“Look, Lurie” — he poked me hard — “you better—“ 

“Rabbi Akiva said that Song of Songs is the holiest of all the books of the Kesuvim. How can you sit there fooling around while we study it?” 

“Where did he say that?” 

“Rashi brings it into his commentary on the first verse.” 

There was subdued laughter from the group around us. Irving Besser’s face went dark. He was one of the best Talmud students in the high school and rarely did a day go by when he did not prove that in class; but he was indifferent to all his other studies and in constant difficulty with his secular courses. He called his secular studies the “goy part of the day.” He would get his degrees with minimal energy. I did not like him and had stayed out of his way until this afternoon.

“You know something else, Besser?” I said. “Someone once said that one third of our study time should be given over to learning Bible. What do you think of that?” 

“Who? One of your apikorsishe grammarians?” 

“Yes. The Rambam.” 

The laughter was loud this time.

His face went very dark. “Where does the Rambam say that?” 

I gave him the source in the law code of Maimonides. He fidgeted uncomfortably, embarrassed and frustrated. 

“You’re making fun of me,” he muttered, readying his finger for another prod. “You’re shaming me.”

“I’m sorry if I am. Don’t make fun of the ones who are trying to study Bible.”
