# Means

Consider including that I participated in inter-congregational events, but still didn’t find the companionship or hope I need (perhaps part of what steps I’ve taken prior to asking for dispensation). I need a new start.

- Longstanding efforts to find support-participation in international programs in the Congregation, leadership development opportunities, vocation promotion groups, etc. I've held out for long as I could.
- The point immediately above is part of what means I've used to get to the point of asking for dispensation.
- Long path leading up to the request for exclaustraton, let alone dispensation: Three retreats, regular spiritual direction, etc.
