# Zoom on a Windows computer

## Installing Zoom

In your browser, go to [zoom.us](https://zoom.us). Scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, then click on the "Meetings Client" link in the footer.

Download the Zoom Client for Meetings.

Look for the downloaded file indicator in the lower left corner of your browser (this example uses Microsoft Edge). Click the arrow at its right side, and choose "Open." (If you don't see the indicator, just double-click on the downloaded installer file. Windows will most likely put it in your Downloads folder, unless you've changed your default download location.)

Follow any instructions the installer provides. If it asks for permissions to access your computer's microphone and camera, grant them.

## Initial setup

The first time you launch Zoom (the installer may launch it automatically when it finishes) you'll see the following screen:

Click "Sign In."

The following screen will provide you with some options for signing in. "Sign in with Google" is your best bet. Zoom will likely ask for permission to use your Google account; be sure to grant it.

## Using Zoom to participate in a meeting

To *join* a Zoom meeting, launch the Zoom app, then click “Join.” (The “New Meeting” button will allow you to *start* a new meeting immediately; the “Schedule” button allows you to schedule a meeting in the future. Unless you’re planning to host meetings yourself, you won’t use these much. The “Share Screen” button does just what you’d expect it does. However, since you need a meeting number to share your screen with, it’s easiest to share your screen from within the meeting itself.)

The organizer of the meeting should have provided you with a meeting ID number. Enter that number in the space provided, and click “Join.” Some meetings require a password; if that’s the case, your meeting organizer will have provided it to you. Enter it when prompted to do so.

If you see the screen below, be sure to click "Join with Computer Audio" so others in the meeting will be able to hear you.

Once you’re in the meeting, the controls shown below will be available to you. Two are especially worth noting: (1) If you’d prefer to participate in the meeting only by voice, you can mute the video camera with the “Stop Video” button. You’ll still be able to see and hear others in the meeting, and they’ll be able to hear you. The button is a toggle, so clicking it again will turn your camera back on. (2) The “Mute” button is also a toggle. In large meetings, it’s customary for anyone who’s not speaking to be on mute, in order to avoid background noise. Just toggle the mic back on whenever you wish to speak.

The other controls are worth exploring, but aren’t essential. When you’re ready to leave the meeting, just click the “End” button in the lower right corner (if the meeting host hasn’t already ended the meeting).
