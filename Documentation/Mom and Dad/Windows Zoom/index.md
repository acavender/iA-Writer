## Using Zoom to participate in a meeting

To *join* a Zoom meeting, launch the Zoom app, then click “Join.” (The “New Meeting” button will allow you to *start* a new meeting immediately; the “Schedule” button allows you to schedule a meeting in the future. Unless you’re planning to host meetings yourself, you won’t use these much. The “Share Screen” button does just what you’d expect it does. However, since you need a meeting number to share your screen with, it’s easiest to share your screen from within the meeting itself.)

The organizer of the meeting should have provided you with a meeting ID number. Enter that number in the space provided, and click “Join.” Some meetings require a password; if that’s the case, your meeting organizer will have provided it to you. Enter it when prompted to do so.

Once you’re in the meeting, the controls shown below will be available to you. Two are especially worth noting: (1) If you’d prefer to participate in the meeting only by voice, you can mute the video camera with the “Stop Video” button. You’ll still be able to see and hear others in the meeting, and they’ll be able to hear you. The button is a toggle, so clicking it again will turn your camera back on. (2) The “Mute” button is also a toggle. In large meetings, it’s customary for anyone who’s not speaking to be on mute, in order to avoid background noise. Just toggle the mic back on whenever you wish to speak.

The other controls are worth exploring, but aren’t essential. When you’re ready to leave the meeting, just click the “End” button in the lower right corner (if the meeting host hasn’t already ended the meeting).
