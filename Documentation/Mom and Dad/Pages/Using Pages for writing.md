# Using Pages for writing

Tap the Pages icon to open the app.

Tap any file that you already have in Pages to keep working on it, or tap “Create Document” to start a new one.

When you create a new document, Pages will ask you what template you want to use. Almost all the time, “Blank” will be what you want (but take some time to explore the others sometime — templates are a great way to create something “fancy” without having to start from scratch).

A new blank document will look something like this:

Type in the document as you would in any word processor.

If you’d like to change the appearance of what you’ve typed, click the paintbrush button to open the formatting pane:

You can select text to change its formatting:

Clicking the “B” after selecting text, for example, changes it to bold font.

Other options in the formatting pane will do other things to the text. For example, you can:
* Make the text *italic*
* Underline it
* Make it ~~strikethrough~~ text

There are also options to change the text alignment, spacing, and indentation level.

It’s also possible to create nicely formatted lists, like the one above. To create one, click on “Bullets & Lists”:

Then choose a style for your list:

If you have multiple lines of text that you want to convert to a list, just select those lines, then click on “Bullets & Lists” and select your style.

When you’re ready to print, send, or otherwise share your document, click on the circle with three dots inside it at the top right (three dots in iOS and iPadOS are often called the “more” indicator).

Choose how you’d like to share the document. In this example, we’ll print it.

Tap “Select Printer” to choose which printer you’d like to use. (If there’s a printer name showing here and you’d like to use a different one, just tap on the name to see what options you have.) If you already see the name of the printer you’d like to use, you can jump ahead to selecting the number of copies and the options you’d like.

/Pages 13.png

Tap the printer you’d like to use to choose it.

Now that the printer’s selected, you can choose the number of copies to print. If the printer supports it, you might also see “Options” here. If you do, you can tap on it to choose whether to print in color, print two-sided, change the paper size, change the print quality -- whatever your printer supports.

Once your copies and options are set to your satisfaction, tap the print button, and you’re done.
