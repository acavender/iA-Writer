# Using 1Password on the iPhone and iPad

## What is 1Password, and why use it?

1Password is a password manager. It keeps track of all your passwords for you, making it possible to have strong, hard-to-guess passwords without your having to remember them. There's only *one* password you need to remember (hence the name of the app) -- your master password. That password should be easy for you to remember, but hard for someone else to guess. (Your master password is stored in a vault that Dad has access to.)

When you land on a site that asks you to sign in, 1Password can automatically fill in your credentials. If you're signing up at a site for the first time, 1Password can automatically generate and save a strong password for you.

If you're logging into an app on your iPhone or iPad rather than a website, there may be times when 1Password doesn't recognize which password you'll need. [^This *can* happen with a website, too, but the issue isn't common.] But there's still no problem there -- just search in 1Password for the password you need, and you can copy and paste.

Though you won't often need to manually add a password to 1Password, it's possible to do that. Most of the time, though, the easiest way for you to add a new password to your vault is to sign in to the website with your existing user name and password. When you do that, 1Password will offer to save the information to your vault, and after that, you'll never again need to remember the password on your own.

## Using 1Password

### A quick tour

You already have an account and are signed in. If you open 1Password directly, [^Often, you won't do that -- you'll just let the app run in the background and do its thing.] here's how things will look.

First, you'll open the app by tapping its icon. You'll be asked to provide your credentials. Ordinarily, the app will assume you want to use TouchID (1). If that doesn't work, or you simply prefer not to use it, you can enter your master password instead.

By default, 1Password will show you *all* passwords, secure notes, etc. that you have access to. If you'd like to see a *specific* vault, just tap the colorful circle at the top left.

When you tap that circle, you'll see something like the following:

In the example above, you'll see that "All Vaults" is selected. You'll also see that your account is part of a family account; there are multiple vaults listed under the account. "Private" is where all your own passwords live. The "Shared" vault is a vault that you, Dad, and I can all see (it's where the Disney and ESPN passwords are, among other things).

It's possible to create additional vaults, and those vaults can be either private or shared. If shared, they can be shared with any mix of people on the account. For example, I know someone who's married and has two daughters -- one in college and one in grad school. Everyone in the family has their own private vault. There's a shared vault that has things like the network password in it; everyone has access to that one. Only Mom and Dad have access to the shared vault with the banking passwords.

That's it for navigating the app.

Here's an example of how using 1Password works with an app. For this example, we'll use the Disney+ app. When you open the app but aren't already signed in, you'll see this screen:

We already have a subscription, so you don't need to sign up. Click "Log In." That will take you to this screen:

When you tap in the email field[^In other apps or websites, this field may be called "user name," "user ID," or something similar.] (1), you'll see the keyboard pop up. At the top of the keyboard you'll see a "Passwords" button (2). Tap it. When you do that, 1Password will ask you to provide your credentials (you won't tap the "Continue" button (3) until later in the process):

If TouchID didn't work, or if you don't want to use it, enter your master password:

1Password will open, and will list any passwords in its vaults that it thinks might be appropriate. In this example, it's listing Disneyplus. That's the password you want, so tap it.

That will take you back to the previous screen. Note that the email field is now filled in. Click "Continue."

Sometimes (it will vary depending on the app and the website) you may need to repeat the above process to enter the password, because only the email (user name, user ID, or whatever the app or website in question calls it) will be entered the first time. Not to worry; the process is identical to the one above.

In this example, though, the password has already been entered, so we're done!
