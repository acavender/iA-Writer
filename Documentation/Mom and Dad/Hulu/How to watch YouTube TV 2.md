# How to watch Hulu (update YouTube instructions below to work for Hulu with Live TV)

## What you'll need:

You'll need only two remotes: the Harmony remote, and the Roku remote. The Harmony remote turns everything on or off and controls the volume. The Roku remote lets you open YouTubeTV and navigate the channels. (It also lets you open other applications on the Roku, such as Netflix. Once you're comfortable with YouTubeTV, you might enjoy exploring.

## Step by step instructions:

1. Using the Harmony remote: Press the "Watch TV" (#1) button while pointing at the TV. It may take a few seconds for everything to turn on.
2. Using the Roku remote: Press the "Home" (#3) button to get to the home screen. (This works much like the home button on the iPhone does â€” it will always take you back to the home screen, no matter where you are, so if you ever get stuck, just press the "Home" button and start over.).
3. Use the arrow keys (#4) to navigate to YouTubeTV. Press "OK" (#5) to open it.
4. Use the arrow keys to move around until "Live" is highlighted. Press "OK" to select it.
5. Step 4 will bring up a grid, showing what's currently on. Channels are listed in alphabetical order. Use the arrow keys to navigate up or down until you find what you want, then press "OK" to select the program.
6. If you want to back up and choose a different program, press the "Back" button (#6). (This button will always take you back to where you were most recently). That should bring you back to the grid, where you can repeat Step 5.
7. When you're finished watching, press the "All Off" (#2) button on the Harmony remote while pointing it toward the TV.
