# Zoom on iPad and iPhone

## Installing Zoom

Start by opening the App Store.

/01-Open App Store and search for Zoom.png

Click inside the search bar and begin typing. Click on the word “zoom” when it appears in your search results.

The Zoom app should be one of the first apps you see. Click on the “GET” button to install it. (You’ll only see the cloud icon if you’ve previously downloaded and then deleted the app from your device.)

Now that the app is installed, you can launch it from wherever you find its icon on your device:

## Initial setup

The first time you run Zoom, you’ll see a sign-in page:

/05-Sign in.png

If you have a Google account, you can use it to sign in (recommended). You can use your Apple ID, if you prefer, or any of the other options you see here (Facebook is not recommended), including providing your email address and a password of your choosing (which you’ll then need to remember). Be aware that Zoom will treat each of these sign-in methods as a different account, so be sure to always use the same sign-in method, should you ever need to go through setup again.

/06-Use Google to sign in.png

If you’ve chosen to log in with Google, you’ll see the dialogue box shown here. Click “Continue” to begin making the necessary connection.

You’ll be prompted to choose a Google account to use with Zoom. Choose the account you’d like to use. (If you’re not already signed in to your Google account on your device, you’ll be prompted to do that.)

/08-Choose Google account.png

Once you’re signed in, Zoom will ask you to confirm your date of birth. Choose the appropriate month, day, and year, then click “Continue” (the “Continue” button will be greyed out until you’ve entered a valid date). 

Zoom must ask for this information on initial setup for age verification purposes (this is a legal requirement). The information is not stored, and you won’t need to enter it again unless you delete and later reinstall the application.

Now that you’ve entered all of the necessary information, you can finish creating your account:

Whether at this point or the next time you launch the application, Zoom will request some permissions. Decide whether you want to grant them, and click the appropriate button in response. Calendar permission is recommended (but not essential). Don’t worry if you accidentally click the wrong button. You can always make changes in the Settings app. (To do that, open the Settings app, then scroll down until you see an icon for Zoom. Click on it, and you’ll see several settings you can experiment with.)

## Using Zoom to participate in a meeting

To *join* a Zoom meeting, launch the Zoom app, then click “Join.” (The “New Meeting” button will allow you to *start* a new meeting immediately; the “Schedule” button allows you to schedule a meeting in the future. Unless you’re planning to host meetings yourself, you won’t use these much. The “Share Screen” button does just what you’d expect it does. However, since you need a meeting number to share your screen with, it’s easiest to share your screen from within the meeting itself.)

/12-Join a meeting.png

The organizer of the meeting should have provided you with a meeting ID number. Enter that number in the space provided, and click “Join.” Some meetings require a password; if that’s the case, your meeting organizer will have provided it to you. Enter it when prompted to do so.

/13-Enter meeting ID.png

The first time you join a meeting (and possibly again in the future, if any settings are inadvertently changed), Zoom will ask for permission to use your audio/mic; you may also be prompted to let it use your device’s camera. You *must* grant these permissions or others in the meeting won’t be able to hear or see you.

/14-Allow Zoom to use audio.png

Once you’re in the meeting, the controls shown below will be available to you. Two are especially worth noting: (1) If you’d prefer to participate in the meeting only by voice, you can mute the video camera with the “Stop Video” button. You’ll still be able to see and hear others in the meeting, and they’ll be able to hear you. The button is a toggle, so clicking it again will turn your camera back on. (2) The “Mute” button is also a toggle. In large meetings, it’s customary for anyone who’s not speaking to be on mute, in order to avoid background noise. Just toggle the mic back on whenever you wish to speak.

The other controls are worth exploring, but aren’t essential. When you’re ready to leave the meeting, just click the “Leave” button in the upper left corner (if the meeting host hasn’t already ended the meeting).
