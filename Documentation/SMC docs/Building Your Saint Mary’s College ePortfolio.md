# Building Your Saint Mary’s College ePortfolio

Building your Saint Mary’s ePortfolio isn’t nearly as daunting as it may seem at first. Just follow the steps below.

## Preliminaries
* Open your preferred browser, and go to [http://commons.saintmarys.edu/](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/).
* Once there, click on the [ePortfolios](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/) link at the top of the page. Doing so will take you to [http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/), where you can learn more about the use of ePortfolios in the Sophia Program. That site also shows the way the menus in a well-structured ePortfolio should be set up.
* When you’ve finished looking around “ePortfolios at Saint Mary’s College,” click on the link to the [Sample Portfolio](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/sampleportfolio/) ([http://commons.saintmarys.edu/sampleportfolio/](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/sampleportfolio/)). That portfolio shows the correct way to set up the “Integration of Learning” section used for the Sophia Program. It also shows some additional possible uses for the portfolio.

## A note on terminology

At Saint Mary’s, your *ePortfolio* is the *web site* you build to showcase your work.

Students build their portfolio sites using *pages*in WordPress. WordPress is a content management system that’s frequently used for blogging, so it’s also possible to create *posts*. What’s the difference?

*  A *page* is static. It does not change unless a user specifically and intentionally goes back to change its content.
* A *post* is something like a journal entry or news item. Posts show up on a blog page, in reverse chronological order.

*ePortfolios are built using **pages**, not posts (though students are welcome to include a blog in their portfolio sites if they wish to do so).*

## Building the ePortfolio
Now that you have a better sense of what ePortfolios are and how they’re used at Saint Mary’s, you may be wondering what you should do first. The [ePortfolios at Saint Mary’s College](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios) site has a link, “[What to Do First](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/building-your-portfolio/),” that provides a handy checklist. Here are the steps:

1. Explore the [ePortfolios at Saint Mary’s College](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/) and [Sample Portfolio](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/sampleportfolio/) sites to see how menus work and to get some ideas for organizing your portfolio.
2. [Register](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/register/) your account and site, if you haven’t already (be sure to read the [instructions](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/signing-up-and-creating-a-site/) first!).
3. Log in (see “Logging In” under the “Using WordPress” tab).
4. [Choose a theme](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/using-wordpress/choosing-a-theme/) that suits you. There are a lot of options.
5. Create a landing page (see “[Creating Pages and Subpages](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/using-wordpress/creating-pages-and-subpages/)” to learn how to create it and the “Blog” page that you’ll also need), and set it as your landing page (you’ll find instructions at “[Setting a Static Page as Your Landing Page](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/using-wordpress/setting-a-static-page-as-your-landing-page/)“).
6. Using [pages](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/using-wordpress/creating-pages-and-subpages/), [subpages](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/using-wordpress/creating-pages-and-subpages/), and [menus](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/using-wordpress/creating-menus/), create your Integration of Learning tab in your portfolio. The [sample portfolio](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/sampleportfolio/) includes an example of how that Integration of Learning tab should be set up.

Note that, in each of the steps listed, there are links to instructions and screencasts that have been created to help users complete the necessary tasks. A full list of instructions and screencasts is available from the “Using WordPress” link (which appears both at [http://commons.saintmarys.edu/](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/) and on the [ePortfolios at Saint Mary’s](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios) site, where it takes the form of a menu).

Once those steps are completed, you have the “container” for the Integration of Learning section of your ePortfolio. All that remains is to add content to the appropriate pages. Instructions for doing that can be found at the “[Adding Images, Files and Links](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/using-wordpress/adding-images-files-and-links/)” page in the “Using WordPress” materials.

## What should a student do when she needs help?

1. The very first thing a student should do is refer back to the “[What to Do First](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/building-your-portfolio/)” page (it’s linked from the [http://commons.saintmarys.edu/](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/), as well as appearing in the [ePortfolios at Saint Mary’s College](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/) site). She should also review the “[Using WordPress](http://commons.saintmarys.edu/eportfolios/using-wordpress/)” section.
2. If, after having consulted the materials above, a student is still having difficulty, she should seek assistance from her peer mentor.
3. If the peer mentor is also unsure what to do, both the student and the peer mentor should feel free to contact Prof. Amy Cavender, CSC. Student workers in the ITRC may also be able to assist.
