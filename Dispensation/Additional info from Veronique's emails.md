# Additional info from Veronique's emails

Dear Amy,
I am sorry that the letter took so long to reach you!  Across-town mail is certainly not what it used to be.

The instructions are the ones sent to us.  I believe that both sentences quoted are examples of vague answers.  The first talks about not being happy in community.  I assume they would like to know what leads to that unhappiness, especially if it revolves around the vows or living the Constitutions of an institute.  

The second sentence is vague in that the structures imposed from outside are not identified, and it may be that “outside” refers to structures of the institute which the person sees as “outside” while her vows would make them structures she has chosen.

I would surmise that most of the letters are one – two pages typed.  The shorter ones have one essential reason for the request, for example, I want to get married to the person I love.  The longer letters have explained a bit more of the “story” of ones life that has led to the request for dispensation.  I have not read many letters.  Some come already sealed and unless there is an overriding reason, I tend not to read the ones which come without being sealed either as they are meant for the Pope.

I hope this helps.  I know that it is often hard to articulate feelings, especially to someone you do not know.  I would just encourage you to speak from your discernment, as you have been clear in your conversations with me.

We will miss Jamie!  I am sorry that she leaves when choir and those with whom she has been close over the years can’t really send her off with celebration.  I am happy for her and she seems very excited about the future.  We are looking at another student from ND’s Sacred Music program to fill in until we can hire more permanently.

I continue to pray for you by name each evening.  Stay well and safe.

Amy,
Thank you for checking in.  I was not worried, as I know that this is a challenging process.  With the pandemic I know that things in Rome are also moving slowly.  I received a response to the General Chapter report that I sent last August (2019) this week!

Regarding your question:  I suggest you sign your religious name and your legal name beneath.  Also, be sure you date the letter.
Know you continue in my prayer by name each evening as I pray for all who are in transition. Stay safe and be well.
Sister Veronique
