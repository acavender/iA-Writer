Most Holy Father,

I am writing to request dispensation from my vows in the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. I believe that I am being called to the single life, and that it is as a single person in the world that I can best love and serve others.

I find that I am not able to live religious life well without the support of a larger number of congregational peers of my own culture and approximate age. I have participated actively in numerous congregational programs meant to bring Sisters from around the world together, so that they can get to know and support one another. These have included common formation experiences, a tertian program, and a leadership development program. I have been a member of the Congregation's Justice and Stewardship Committees, both of which are international, and I have lived with Sisters from other countries, w. All of these experiences have provided the opportunity to get to know Sisters in my approximate age group from around the world. I appreciate these opportunities and value these relationships, but they do not provide the peer support I need.

Coming to this conclusion has not been easy, because I take commitments very seriously. It took two years of prayer and discernment for me to reach the decision even to request exclaustration. This discernment has been the focus of three of my yearly eight-day retreats, two of them with a Jesuit director who has directed my retreat on many occasions over the last several years. Outside of retreats, I have also been discerning this request with my regular spiritual director, and I have sought the counsel of those who know me well.

When I entered the Congregation, Holy Cross was an international community that was mission-sending. There were Sisters who served abroad for most of their lives, but they were a small group; most remained in their home countries. I entered with the expectation that though I would have international experience, I would live and serve in the United States.

At that time, there were other women from the United States in the community who were close to my age. I was never under any illusion that there would be *many* Sisters of my own culture in my approximate age group and younger, but my early experience of the Congregation gave me reason to think there would be *some*.

The situation I now experience is vastly different. Only three Sisters from the United States are under the age of sixty; none are under forty. There is no one from the U.S. in formation, nor is there interest in the Congregation on the part of younger American women. Holy Cross's new life is outside the United States. I am pleased that there is a bright future for the Congregation, but I do not see a place for myself in that future.

One of the most important things I have learned in my time in Holy Cross is to listen to my heart. In my early years in the Congregation, I was sometimes asked whether the small number of women from the U.S. near my age concerned me. My response was that I did not expect a large number of new entrants, but I thought there would be a few, and I did not think the small number should matter.

Though I honestly believed that, concerns about the Congregation’s demographics, and whether I would find the support I needed to live religious life well, tugged at my heart. I recall giving voice to these concerns to another Sister a year before I made perpetual vows. At the time, I thought that I was simply not giving into fear and remaining firm in my commitment by moving ahead with profession despite my concerns. I now believe I should have paid more attention to the misgivings of my heart. 

Having lived and served for twenty months in Uganda, I also know from first-hand experience that I am not called to live outside my home country. Living outside the United States holds no attraction for me.

Living as a single person, however, *does* attract. I lived alone for approximately thirty months prior to requesting exclaustration, and I found that living singly suits me well. My time in exclaustration has given me the opportunity to further test the call to single life.

As I’ve continued my discernment during exclaustration, I have paid close attention to my experience and to the stirrings of my heart. I have been able to support myself financially without difficulty. More importantly, emotionally and spiritually, I’ve found myself content and happy — at peace. Since beginning exclaustration, I am less anxious and more hopeful than I was previously. Others have also noticed that I am more at peace than I have been in some time; my spiritual director, friends, family, and colleagues have all commented on it.

As I look to the future, I realize that it is uncertain. As I have been discerned my choice, I have often tried to imagine a future in which I return to active membership in the Congregation, and a future in which I seek dispensation from my vows to live as a single person.

When I look to that uncertain future and picture myself remaining within the Congregation, I experience a sense of uncertainty and of dread. My emotions are in turmoil when I consider this choice.

When I picture myself in that uncertain future as a single person, however, I experience a sense of genuine freedom and possibility. There is a persistent hopefulness as I contemplate this choice that is not present when I contemplate a return to active membership in the Congregation. When I consider moving forward as a single person, I experience a sense of peace.
