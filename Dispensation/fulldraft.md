Most Holy Father,

I am writing to request dispensation from my vows in the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. I have come to believe that I am being called to the single life, and that it is as a single person in the world that I can best love and serve others.

At the time I entered the Congregation, Holy Cross was an international community that was mission-sending. Though there were Sisters who served abroad for most of their lives, they were a small group. The large majority of Sisters remained in their home countries. I entered with the expectation that I would have some international experience, but would live and serve in the United States.

There were also, at that time, other women from the United States in the community who were reasonably close to my age. There were not huge numbers, but there were some, and there were even a few who followed me as candidates. I was never under any illusion that there would be many in my approximate age group and younger, but looking to the example of those slightly older than me in the Congregation and to my own experience of “Come and See” weekends and vocation groups, I had good reason to believe there would be a small but steady number entering.

The situation I now experience is vastly different. In the United States, there are now just three members of the Congregation under the age of sixty. There is no one from the United States under the age of forty. There is no one from the U.S. in formation, nor is there much interest in the Congregation on the part of younger American women.

Holy Cross is experiencing its new life outside the United States. As a result, it has changed in ways that are both necessary and healthy for its continued mission. There is clearly a future for the Congregation, and that pleases me very much. I do not, however, see a place for myself in that future.

One of the valuable things I have learned in my time in Holy Cross is to listen to my heart. In my earliest years in the Congregation, friends and family occasionally asked me whether I was concerned about the small number of women from the U.S. near my age. My response at that time was that I did not expect a large number of such women, but I thought there would be some, and in any case the situation would certainly not improve if those of us with an interest in the community let that concern deter us. I did not think the small number should matter.

I honestly believed that at the time, but concerns about the congregation’s demographics tugged at my heart. I do not remember exactly when I gave first gave voice to my concerns, but I recall mentioning them to another Sister a year before I made perpetual vows. At the time, I thought that I was simply not giving into fear by moving ahead with profession, and that I was remaining firm in my commitment. I have since come to believe I should have paid more attention to what my heart was telling me.

Circumstances — which I believe are one of the means through which God speaks to us — have pushed me in the direction of single life, which increasingly attracts me. Demographics are one factor in that. I no longer believe I can live religious life in Holy Cross without the support of a larger number of peers of my own place and culture who are also living it. I also know from first-hand experience (I spent twenty months living and serving in Uganda) that I am not called to live outside my home country. Living outside the United States holds no attraction for me.

Living as a single person in the world, however, *does* attract. I lived alone for approximately thirty months prior to requesting exclaustration, and I found that living singly fits me well. My time in exclaustration has given me the opportunity to further test the call to single life.

In my discernment process during exclaustration, I have paid close attention to my experience and to the stirrings of my heart. How well am I handling the tasks associated with living on one’s own? Am I able to support myself? As I look to two possible futures — a return to active membership in the Congregation or a dispensation from vows and an embrace of a new way of life — what kind of energy and emotions do I experience? What do those say to me about where God is leading me?

I have found that I can support myself financially; I can meet my expenses without difficulty and have been able to begin building an emergency fund and some modest savings.

Emotionally, I’ve found myself content and happy — at peace. Since beginning exclaustration, I find myself less anxious and more hopeful than I was previously. I have felt more myself than I have in a long time. Others have also noticed that I am more at peace than I have been in some time; friends, family, and colleagues have all commented on it.

As I look to the future, I realize that it is uncertain — as it always is, though perhaps even more so in these strange and challenging times. There is risk involved no matter the path I take. As I have been discerned my choice, I have frequently tried to imagine a future in which I return to active membership in the Congregation, and a future in which I seek dispensation from my vows and continue as a single person in the world.

When I look to that uncertain future and picture myself remaining within the Congregation, I experience a sense of uncertainty and of dread. My emotions are in turmoil when I consider this option.

When I picture myself in that uncertain future as a single person, however, I experience a sense of uncertainty, but also a sense of genuine freedom and possibility. There is a persistent hopefulness as I contemplate this possibility that simply is not there when I contemplate a return to active membership in the Congregation. When I consider moving forward as a single person, I experience a sense of peace.

<!-- Means: Consider including that I participated in inter-congregational events, but still didn’t find the companionship or hope I need (perhaps part of what steps I’ve taken prior to asking for dispensation). I need a new start. (1) Longstanding efforts to find support-participation in international programs in the Congregation, leadership development opportunities, vocation promotion groups, etc. I've held out for long as I could. (2) The point immediately above is part of what means I've used to get to the point of asking for dispensation. (3) Long path leading up to the request for exclaustration, let alone dispensation: Three retreats, regular spiritual direction, etc. -->

Reaching this conclusion has been far from easy, in no small part because I take commitments very seriously. In fact, it took two years of prayer and discernment to reach the decision to ask for exclaustration. This discernment process has been the focus of three of my yearly eight-day retreats. Two of those retreats were with a director who knows me well, as he has directed my annual retreat on multiple occasions since 2011. Outside of retreats, I have been discerning this request with my regular spiritual director, and I have sought the counsel of those who know me well.

<!--A paragraph about my employments in the congregation goes here, along with reiteration of my request for dispensation goes here. Principal employments: young adult ministry for the diocese and teaching at Holy Cross College (candidate); volunteer tutor at youth center in LA and intern at Jubilee USA Network (novice); secondary school math teacher and campus ministry work at Lakeview, lecturer at PCJ, vocation promotion (Uganda); teaching at Saint Mary's, committee work (Justice, Stewardship, local vocation group), Chapter (2014) delegate).-->

I humbly beseech the blessing of Your Holiness,
