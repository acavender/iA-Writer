## August 2019

Dear Joy:

I never expected to be writing this letter, but write it I must. I’m writing to request exclaustration, as I increasingly believe I’m being called to the single life.

I've been discerning this request for over two years. (One of the reasons I wouldn't let my name go forward as a potential delegate for the 2019 Chapter was that I was already well into this discernment, and I couldn’t accept nomination with any sense of integrity.) The discernment has been a focus of three yearly retreats (2017, 2018, and 2019), two of those with a retreat director who knows me well, as he’s directed my annual retreat on multiple occasions. I've also been exploring the question regularly with my spiritual director, and have discussed my discernment with a few close friends.

At the time I entered the Congregation, we were an international community that was mission-sending. Though there were Sisters who served abroad for most of their ministerial lives, they were a small group. The large majority of Sisters remained in their home countries. I entered with the expectation that I would have some international experience, but would live and minister in the United States.

There were also, at that time, other women from the United States in the community who were reasonably close to my age. There weren’t huge numbers, but there were some, and there were even a few who followed me as candidates. I was under no illusion that there’d ever be *many* in my approximate age group and younger, but looking to the example of those just a bit older than me in the Congregation and to my own experience of “Come and See” weekends and vocation groups, I had reason to believe there’d be *some*.

The situation I now experience is vastly different. In the United States, there are now just three of us under the age of sixty. There is no one from the United States under the age of forty. We have no one from the U.S. in formation, nor does there seem to be much interest on the part of younger women in this country.

Holy Cross is experiencing its new life outside the United States. As a result, it has changed in ways that I think are both necessary and healthy for its continued mission. There’s clearly a future for the Congregation, and that pleases me very much.

I do not, however, see a place where I can be healthy and happy in that future, and thus able to serve well. The fact is that I'm not happy in the Congregation, and haven't been for some time, if I'm honest with myself.

One of the valuable things I've learned in my time in Holy Cross is to listen to my heart. In my earliest years in the Congregation, friends and family occasionally asked me whether I wasn’t concerned about the small number of younger people from the U.S. My response at that time was that I didn’t expect a large number of younger people, but thought there’d be some, and in any case the situation would certainly not improve if younger people with an interest in the community let that concern deter them. I didn’t think the small number should matter.

Though I honestly believed that at the time, concerns about our demographics tugged at my heart. I don’t recall exactly when I gave first gave voice to those concerns, but I do remember mentioning them during the Common Initial Formation Program in the summer of 2006. At the time though, I thought that I was simply not giving into fear by moving ahead, and remaining firm in my commitment. I’ve come to believe I should have paid more attention to what my heart was telling me.

Circumstances (which I believe are one of the means through which God speaks to us) appear to be pushing me in the direction of single life, which increasingly attracts me. Demographics are one factor in that. I no longer believe I can live religious life in Holy Cross without the support of a larger number of peers of my own place and culture who are also living it. I also know from first-hand experience (twenty months living and ministering in Uganda) that I am not called to live outside my home country. Living outside the United States simply holds no attraction for me.

Living as a single person in the world, however, *does* attract. There’s a degree to which I’ve already begun testing parts of that way of life. For the past two and a half years, I’ve been living alone. (For the first eighteen months of that time, Sister Nohemí was officially living with me, but she was usually away at school.) Living singly seems to fit me well. I believe it’s time for me to test the call to single life further through a period of exclaustration that will allow me to test more aspects of it (such as responsibility for decision-making and supporting myself financially).

Deciding to make this request has been far from easy, because I take commitments very seriously. I've had to remind myself on several occasions that the Church makes provision for this kind of request. Yet as I’ve discussed my discernment with a few close friends and have begun to tell a few more people — on a need to know basis — that this request was probable, I’ve experienced a sense of peace and rightness about the decision.

Years ago, as I was preparing to enter the Congregation, I said that, though I wasn’t 100% sure that I was called to religious life in Holy Cross, I was sure enough that I needed to take the next step in formal discernment. I didn't want to wake up the day I turned 40 and ask myself, “What if? What if I’d tested it out?” Now I find myself in a similar position. I’m reasonably sure that my call now lies elsewhere, and I don't want to wake up the day I turn 60 and have to ask myself that question.

I need to take that next step in my discernment, so I’m asking that you forward my request to Sr. Veronique.

## July 2020

Dear Sr. Veronique:

I’m writing to update you on my discernment during this period of exclaustration.

In the letter I wrote last August to Sr. Joy O’Grady, requesting that she forward my request for exclaustration to you, I detailed the situation that led me to believe I’ve been experiencing a call to the single life: a long-standing and deepening concern about the Congregation’s demographics, particularly in the United States; my conviction that I am not called to live outside my home country; my unhappiness in the Congregation; and my attraction to the single life.

I noted in the letter that, though Holy Cross clearly has a future, which pleases me a great deal, I did not see a place where I could be happy and healthy in that future, and thus able to serve well.

In the past ten months, I’ve had the opportunity to test that call to singleness. In my discernment process, I’ve paid close attention to my experience and to the stirrings of my heart. How well am I handling the tasks associated with living on one’s own? Am I able to support myself? As I look to two possible futures — a return to active membership in the Congregation or a dispensation from vows and an embrace of a new way of life — what kind of energy and emotions do I experience? What do those say to me about where I’m being led?

Financially, the transition into living singly has been very smooth. Since beginning to receive my own paycheck, I’ve been able to be completely independent. I’ve been able to meet my expenses without difficulty, and have purchased a car. Since I’m on a ten-month contract with my employer and am only paid ten months each year, I need to save in order to meet my expenses during the two months in which I don’t receive a paycheck. I’ve
learned that I have the discipline necessary to do that, and I’m even starting to build an emergency fund and some modest savings. I’ve developed confidence in my ability to support myself.

Emotionally, I’ve found myself content and happy — at peace. I’m handling stress much better than previously, and am sleeping better, too. I’m less anxious, more hopeful. I’ve felt more myself, more at home in my own skin, than I have in a long time. Given that I’d been discerning my request for exclaustration for over two years, some of that experience might have been expected as an initial relief at having finally made a decision. That these feelings have remained constant over the last ten months, however, is significant, and I see it as a confirmation that I’m on the right path.

Others have also noticed that I’m more at ease than I’ve been in some time. Friends, family, and colleagues have told me that I seem to be at peace.

Finally, as I look to the future, I realize that it’s uncertain — as it always is, though perhaps even more so in these strange and challenging times. There is risk involved no matter the path I take. As I’ve been discerning my choice, I’ve frequently tried to imagine a future in which I return to active membership in the Congregation, and a future in which I seek dispensation from my vows and continue as a single person in the world.

When I look to that uncertain future and picture myself remaining within the Congregation, I feel a sense of uncertainty and of dread — of walls closing in. I just don’t see a future in which I’d be happy and healthy; I’m not able to see things differently than I did when I requested exclaustration. I find my emotions in turmoil when I consider this option.

When I picture myself in that uncertain future as a single person, however, I feel a sense of uncertainty, of course — but also a sense of genuine freedom and possibility. There’s a persistent hopefulness as I contemplate this possibility that simply isn’t there when I contemplate a return to active membership in Holy Cross. When I consider moving forward as a single person, I experience a sense of peace.

These last ten months have confirmed for me that my path lies outside the Congregation. Though I am grateful for my years in Holy Cross, it’s become very clear to me that I am happier, more at ease with myself and with others, and therefore better able to offer myself in service as a single person in the world.

I thus intend to request dispensation from my vows, and request your support for this decision. I realize that you will need to discuss my request with the General Leadership Team, and I understand that I will need to write a letter to Pope Francis requesting dispensation. I trust you’ll advise me of how that process works, and anything else that might be required.
I very much appreciate your prayerful support these last many months. This has not been an easy decision, but I’m confident that it’s the correct one.
