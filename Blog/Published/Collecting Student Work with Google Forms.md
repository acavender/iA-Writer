# Collecting Student Work with Google Forms

A good number of us here at *ProfHacker* prefer to avoid paper whenever possible. When I teach my writing course each fall, I have my students use Google Documents so that it’s easy to see an essay’s development over time.

For classes where it’s not essential that I see a student’s revisions, I prefer that essays be submitted in PDF format, so that I can comment on essays using my iPad. (My current favorite app for this purpose is [PDFExpert][2]; [Jason][3] and [Erin][4] have both made use of [iAnnotate][5].)

What I’ve always found a bit of a bother, though, is organizing those PDFs. I’d looked around a bit, but I hadn’t found a good way to streamline the process.

Until recently, that is. Not long ago, I was checking something for a colleague in Google Forms, and I discovered a feature that apparently rolled out back in October: the ability to [upload files][6].

This feature provides the kind of streamlined organization process I was looking for. For assignment submission, I can provide students with a link to a Google Form that contains a file upload question:

If I want to ensure that students submit their essays in PDF format, I can set the question to allow *only* that file type:

The results spreadsheet will contain links to files that students upload.

What makes this feature so useful to me, though, is that Google Forms creates a *folder* corresponding to the form. Within that folder, it creates one folder for each question of the “file upload” type. *That* folder, as one might expect, contains all files uploaded in response to the question.

Because PDFExpert allows me to sync particular Google Drive folders with the app, there’s nothing I need to do to organize my students’ essays once I’ve collected them via the form. I can open essays in PDFExpert and mark them up as appropriate; all of my annotations will sync with the relevant Google Drive folder. I can then return students’ work by sending each student a link to her marked essay (alternatively, I could send it to her as an attachment).

The only drawbacks I’ve discovered so far are (1) that the feature is only available to G Suite users and (2) that only users within one’s own organization can upload files. So the feature’s not available for personal accounts, or for those who have a grandfathered Google Apps for Your Domain setup. Anyone working at a campus already using Google apps, though, should be able to take advantage of the new(-ish) feature.
